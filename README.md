# Socrates Workshop

Every year, the central administration of the planet Corellia causes great chaos and confusion among its citizens as to when they should put out their garbage cans. The central administration provides a wide variety of documents from which citizens have to pick their own dates - and mistakes easily happen in the process. And mistakes lead to garbage being left lying around - a disaster that is also reflected in the number of complaints to the central administration. The documents are located as CSV files under `csv`. These were entered manually by students.

We, the Garbage Empire, have taken over to bring order into this chaos.

Your product owner wants to have a software that supports the following scenario:

> Bob lives in "Spacer's Row 89" and would like to be able to check in how many days the paper waste is collected.

Notes:
- Start implementing the core logic. Do not care about HTML or user interfaces for now.
- Make assumptions when necessary
- Use the PO-signal if you need clarification on a requirement. But keep in mind that the PO is new to the Garbage Empire.
